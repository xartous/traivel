    """
    Remove non-printable characters from a given string.

    This function uses a regular expression to identify and remove characters
    that are not typically visible or printable. These include control characters
    like line breaks, carriage returns, and other ASCII control characters.

    Parameters:
    s (str): The string from which non-printable characters are to be removed.

    Returns:
    str: A string with non-printable characters removed.

    # The pattern covers ASCII control characters from 0x00 to 0x1F and 0x7F

    # Use the sub() method of the compiled pattern to replace non-printable characters
    # The replacement string is an empty string, effectively removing the characters
    return nonprintable_pattern.sub('', s)

# Example usage
# cleaned_string = remove_nonprintable_chars(original_string)
